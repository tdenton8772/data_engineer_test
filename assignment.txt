Data Engineer Take-Home Project
-------------------------------

The 'voters/' directory contains a set of voter data for the following
Florida counties:

    - Alachua
    - Orange
    - Seminole

The included Data Dictionary (DataDictionary.xlsx) includes a sheet for each
file, describing that file's contents. In each data set, one row represents a
registered voter, with columns for basic voter attributes (name, birthdate,
party, etc.)

Feel free to use any python packages you'd like, including those not in the
standard library. You may include comments to explain your thought process
along the way.


1)  Write a python script to combine the voter data from all three counties
    into a single CSV file with the following columns:

        - regnum (the unique identifier)
        - county
        - first_name
        - middle_name
        - last_name
        - party
        - birthdate
        - sex
    
    If any of the above columns are missing from a county's voter data, fill
    the missing values with empty strings (''). The python script should create
    a file called 'voters.csv' with the combined voter records from all three
    counties.


2)  Assume we have a single SQL table with the contents of the data generated
    in step 1:

    column      | type
    ------------|-----
    regnum      | text
    first_name  | text
    middle_name | text
    last_name   | text
    party       | text
    birthdate   | date
    sex         | text


    Write a SQL statement to generate a count of each party by county, but
    only among voters over the age of 60. The output should look like this:

    party | county   | count
    ------|----------|------
    DEM   | ALACHUA  |   100
    OTH   | ALACHUA  |   191
    REP   | ALACHUA  |   182
    DEM   | ORANGE   |   110
    OTH   | ORANGE   |   441
    REP   | ORANGE   |   341
    DEM   | SEMINOLE |   898
    OTH   | SEMINOLE |   999
    REP   | SEMINOLE |   100

    (The values in the "count" column above are for illustrative purposes only.)

    There is no need to generate the actual counts; the SQL statement to
    generate the above results will suffice.
